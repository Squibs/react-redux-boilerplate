# React Boilerplate

A personal starting point for my own React projects. For now this is a slight variation/bootstrap of Stephen Grider's [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter). I am aiming to evolve this boilerplate overtime, as I learn, to suite myself.

If nothing else this will simply serve to help me understand Webpack more.

At the moment I am structuring this boilerplate to not be very portable/modular as it could be. I am putting all assets in one spot. I am definitely looking to use the ducks/re-ducks methods of folder structure for the future. Many projects starting out, as I learn React, are going to be small in nature and as soon as my projects start to get larger... I will definitely be adapting this boilerplate to match.

For future reference (switching from function-first to feature-first folder structure):
